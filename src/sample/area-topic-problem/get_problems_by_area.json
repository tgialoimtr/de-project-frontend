            "rationale": "To maximize the number of pets adopted, we should maximize the number of dogs adopted since 1/4 > 1/5.\nThe greatest multiple of 4 less than 45 is 40 (such that the remaining number is divisible by 5), so let's assume there were 40 dogs and 5 cats.\nThen the maximum number of adopted pets is 1/4*(40) + 1/5*(5) = 10 + 1 = 11.\nThe answer is B.",

One and a half hours later, they are again 40 miles apart, driving away from each other. If Otto drives at a speed of x miles per hour, then, in terms of x, Han drives at a speed of how many miles per hour?",
            "rationale": "Let's say the two cars have speeds V1 and V2. The fact that they are moving in opposite direction means that their relative speed is (V1 + V2). In other words, any gap between them will be changing in size at a rate of (V1 + V2). It doesn't matter whether they are moving toward each other or away from each other. If they are approaching each other, the gap between them is decreasing at a rate of (V1 + V2). If they are moving away from each other, the gap between them is increasing at a rate of (V1 + V2). Either way, the number for the rate of change remains the same.\nHere, the two cars approach a distance 40 mi, then move away from each other another distance of 40 miles. That's a total distance of 80 miles in 1.5 hr, which gives a rate of:\nR = (80 mi)/(1.5) = 53.33 mph\nThat's the rate of change of the gap, so it must equal the sum of the speeds of the two cars.\nOne of the speeds is x, and let's call the other y. We want y.\nx + y = 53.33\ny = 53.33 - x\nAnswer =(B)",

The key detail to immediately recognize is that the problem gives you Andrew and Charlie’s totals in relation to Bradley’s total rather than giving you Bradley’s total in relation to the other two; and then the problem asks you to solve the problem in terms of b. This means that you have to relate Andrew and Charlie’s values in relation to Bradley’s total.

By gaining this insight, it makes it easier to solve the problem.\nStep 3: Solve the problem\nb = Bradley’s total\n3b = Andrew’s total\n(1/2)b = Charlie’s total\nAdd each total\nb + 3b+ (1/2)b = 4b + (1/2)b = (16/4)b + (1/2)b = (9/2)b\nTherefore,choose D.",

Therefore, the new speed is V=50+20=70V=50+20=70 km/hr. If xx is the number of hours according to the schedule, then at the speed of 50 km/hr the bus travels from A to B within (x+4260)(x+4260) hr.

John eventually performed on all 30 days of the festival, while David performed on 5 fewer days than John performed. If David gives John y dollars of her advance payment so that they would have each received the same daily rate, what was John paid in advance, in terms of Y?",
            "rationale": "Both of them were given X $ each\nDavid to adjust Y $ in advance to John\nSo David now has (X-Y)$ and John has (X+Y) $ such that their daily rate becomes same\nSo Rate of David= Rate of John\nAlso , David works for 25 days and John works for full 30 days\n(X-Y) / 25 = (X+Y) / 30\nSolving 30x-30y=25x+25y =>5x=55y => x=55/5y\nX= 11Y\nAnswer : A",
